A basic solver for the New York Times "Spelling Bee" game.

Uses the 2009 Webster's unabridged English Dictionary, from the Gutenberg Project, parsed into json by the lovely folks at https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary

Will suggest some words not-accepted by the NYT, as they build their wordlist
from an undisclosed dictionary, and do some filtering for relevance of words
in solution.
